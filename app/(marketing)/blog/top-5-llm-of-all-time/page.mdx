## 1. Listening for buyer intent around the clock

Vatas parse Reddit threads, LinkedIn comments, and Discord chats every minute to flag buying signals and reply faster than any human refresh.

## 2. Qualifying prospects with your playbooks

Training on your ICP, pricing guardrails, and case studies lets vatas ask the right questions and escalate only qualified leads.

## 3. Personalizing follow-up at scale

After meetings, vatas send tailored recaps, share resources, and answer objections with knowledge-hub context while reps rest.

## 4. Re-engaging dormant leads automatically

Dormant threads, emails, and offers are revisited on smart cadences with new angles pulled from past interactions.

## 5. Delivering analytics humans actually use

Dashboards show sourced pipeline, time saved, and which assets convert, guiding where humans focus next.
