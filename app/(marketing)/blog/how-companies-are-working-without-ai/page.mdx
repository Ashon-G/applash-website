## The challenge: outbound never sleeps

Prospecting rarely stops, yet most teams can't afford a 24/7 crew. Reps burn hours combing social threads, Slack groups, and inboxes before they ever reach a decision maker. Opportunities slip away overnight, and managers lose visibility into what was said.

## Deploying vatas as digital sales reps

Vatas connect to every social network and knowledge source your team already uses. They listen for buying signals, join relevant conversations, and book meetings that match your ICP. Because the agents learn from your assets, their outreach feels like it came from your best-performing rep.

## Keeping humans focused on closing

All activity flows into the inbox so managers can review, approve, or jump in. When an agent needs help, they escalate in context and store your answer. Your reps walk into the office with a queue of qualified meetings instead of a list of cold tasks.

## The payoff: pipeline without headcount creep

Teams running Vatas see more conversations, faster follow-up, and cleaner handoffs to AEs. With pay-for-results pricing, finance tracks every invoice back to real pipeline, allowing you to scale revenue without adding salaries until you are ready.
