## The challenge: outbound never sleeps

Outbound never stops, yet most teams can't staff 24/7. Reps burn hours combing social threads and inboxes while opportunities slip overnight and managers lose visibility.

## Deploying vatas as digital sales reps

Vatas connect to your social networks and knowledge sources, listen for buying signals, join the right conversations, and book meetings that match your ICP with on-brand outreach.

## Keeping humans focused on closing

Activity lives in the inbox so managers review, approve, or jump in. Escalations store your answers, and reps start the day with qualified meetings instead of cold tasks.

## The payoff: pipeline without headcount creep

Teams see more conversations, faster follow-up, and clean handoffs. Pay-for-results pricing ties every invoice to real pipeline so revenue scales without new salaries.
