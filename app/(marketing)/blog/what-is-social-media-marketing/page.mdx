## Connect the channels your buyers trust

Vatas plug into LinkedIn, Reddit, X, and industry communities to watch for buyer signals. You set personas and keywords, and agents surface matching conversations before competitors arrive.

## Teach each agent what a qualified lead looks like

Knowledge hub data powers qualification. Feed CRM wins, support transcripts, and analytics so vatas know the difference between curiosity and intent, with scoring rules gating your pipeline.

## Keep humans in the loop through the inbox

Every outreach, reply, and escalation lands in the inbox where managers review and approve. Escalations capture your guidance as saved replies for next time.

## Route opportunities with full context

Once qualified, Vatas sync transcripts, contact data, and next steps into your CRM so reps take over with full visibility while automated nurture keeps prospects warm.
