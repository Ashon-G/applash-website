## Connect the channels your buyers trust

Vatas plug directly into LinkedIn, Reddit, X, and industry communities to listen for buying signals. You decide which personas and keywords matter, and the agents surface conversations that match your playbooks before competitors even see them.

## Teach each agent what a qualified lead looks like

Knowledge hub data powers the qualification engine. Feed CRM wins, support transcripts, and analytics so vatas understand the difference between curiosity and purchase intent. Scoring rules ensure only ready-to-talk opportunities hit your pipeline.

## Keep humans in the loop through the inbox

Every outreach, reply, and escalation lands in the inbox where managers can review and approve. If a vata needs help, your guidance becomes a saved response so future conversations resolve automatically.

## Route opportunities with full context

Once a prospect is qualified, Vatas sync transcripts, contact data, and recommended next steps into your CRM. Reps pick up the conversation with complete visibility, while automated nurture keeps prospects warm until the meeting.
