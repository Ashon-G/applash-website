## Q1 2024 — Training the knowledge hub

We opened the year by launching the Vatas knowledge hub. Teams can now connect Google Drive, Notion, Dropbox, and their analytics warehouse to feed agents the exact messaging, product specs, and case studies they need. Version history and tagging make it easy to tailor talking points by persona or region without duplicating documents.

To make onboarding seamless, we also added guided playbook creation. Upload your ideal customer profile, objection handling notes, and call recordings; within minutes, vatas begin mirroring the tone of your top performers.

## Q2 2024 — Inbox oversight and escalation memory

April introduced the unified inbox. Revenue leaders get a live feed of every social conversation, approval request, and escalation. When an agent hits a blocker, your answer is saved to the knowledge graph automatically so the next vata handles the question on its own.

This quarter also added Slack and Microsoft Teams notifications. Your team can approve replies or drop in additional context right from their preferred workspace, keeping sales momentum high even on mobile.

## Q3 2024 — Performance analytics and CRM syncs

Summer shipped our analytics overhaul. Dashboards now show sourced pipeline, win rates, conversation sentiment, and time saved compared to manual prospecting. Native integrations with HubSpot, Salesforce, and Close pass transcripts, contact data, and qualification notes straight into your CRM.

We also introduced lead verification. Before a contact hits your pipeline, Vatas cross-check role, company fit, and intent signals to ensure every opportunity meets your thresholds.

## Q4 2024 — Partner program and governance controls

To close out the year we launched the partner workspace. Agencies and consultants can manage multiple client accounts, share knowledge hubs, and earn revenue share on every closed lead. Enterprise teams gained granular permissions, audit trails, and single sign-on to meet compliance requirements.

Finally, we rolled out multilingual outreach and region-aware playbooks so vatas can sell into new markets the moment you are ready.

### Looking ahead to 2025

Next year we are focused on predictive routing and deeper analytics into how each knowledge asset influences conversion rates. Follow along here or inside the product to see how the Vatas digital sales force keeps leveling up.
