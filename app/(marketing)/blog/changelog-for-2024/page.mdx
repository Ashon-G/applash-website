## Q1 2024 — Training the knowledge hub

We launched the Vatas knowledge hub with Google Drive, Notion, Dropbox, and warehouse syncs so agents get the exact messaging fast. Guided playbooks let teams upload ICPs, objection notes, and calls, helping vatas mirror top performers within minutes.

## Q2 2024 — Inbox oversight and escalation memory

April brought a unified inbox that shows every conversation, approval, and escalation in one stream. Slack and Microsoft Teams alerts let leaders approve replies or add context, and every answer auto-saves to the knowledge graph.

## Q3 2024 — Performance analytics and CRM syncs

Summer delivered dashboards for sourced pipeline, win rates, sentiment, and time saved, plus native HubSpot, Salesforce, and Close syncs. Lead verification now checks role, company fit, and intent before anything reaches your CRM.

## Q4 2024 — Partner program and governance controls

We rolled out partner workspaces so agencies manage clients, share hubs, and earn revenue share, while enterprises gained granular permissions, audit trails, and single sign-on. Multilingual outreach and region-aware playbooks let vatas sell in new markets instantly.

### Looking ahead to 2025

Next year focuses on predictive routing and deeper analytics into which knowledge assets move deals. Follow along here or inside the product as the Vatas sales force levels up.
