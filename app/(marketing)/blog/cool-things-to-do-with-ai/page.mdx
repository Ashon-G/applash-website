## Activate community listening on niche networks

High-intent conversations rarely happen in your own channels. By connecting Reddit, Slack communities, and product forums, teams let vatas monitor threads in real time. The agents jump in with relevant answers pulled from your knowledge hub, then invite qualified posters into a direct conversation.

## Spin up launches without adding headcount

Founders use Vatas to support product launches on autopilot. Connect your release notes and pitch decks, set the target persona, and vatas fan out across LinkedIn and industry Discords highlighting the new feature set. Human reps only get looped in when someone asks for pricing or a custom demo.

## Teach vatas from support tickets and call recordings

Support teams feed resolved ticket transcripts and top-performing discovery calls into the knowledge hub. The agents reuse that language to answer common questions before they hit your help desk, freeing humans for complex issues while keeping messaging perfectly aligned across the buyer journey.

## Pair human closers with AI follow-up

Revenue leaders pair each account executive with a vata that handles pre-meeting research, post-demo recaps, and long-tail nurture. The agent synthesizes call notes, highlights next steps, and keeps prospects warm while the rep focuses on closing the deal.
