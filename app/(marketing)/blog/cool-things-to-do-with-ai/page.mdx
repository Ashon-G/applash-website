## Activate community listening on niche networks

Connect Reddit, Slack communities, and forums so vatas monitor threads in real time. They jump in with knowledge-hub answers and invite qualified posters into a direct conversation.

## Spin up launches without adding headcount

Load release notes and target personas, and vatas fan out across LinkedIn and industry Discords to spotlight the launch. Humans step in only for pricing questions or custom demos.

## Teach vatas from support tickets and call recordings

Drop resolved tickets and top discovery calls into the knowledge hub so agents reuse proven language before questions hit your help desk.

## Pair human closers with AI follow-up

Pair each account executive with a vata that handles research, post-demo recaps, and long-tail nurture so reps stay focused on closing.
