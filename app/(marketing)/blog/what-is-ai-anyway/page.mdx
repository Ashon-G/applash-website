## An autonomous sales force built for social channels

Vatas are always-on AI agents that live in the social networks your buyers use. Connect LinkedIn, Reddit, forums, and email so they listen for signals, engage prospects, and book meetings that match your ICP.

## Feed agents the knowledge that makes you different

During onboarding you connect storage, analytics, and support systems so vatas learn product, pricing, and stories. The knowledge hub keeps everything versioned and tagged so outreach stays current and compliant.

## Human-in-the-loop when nuance is required

If a prospect asks something new, a vata escalates in the inbox, logs your answer, and handles the next one solo. You keep oversight while AI handles repetition.

## Pay only for the results you can see

Pay $50 per qualified lead, and move to the $399/month subscription once you're closing more than twenty new wins with the same accountability.
