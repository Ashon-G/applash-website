## An autonomous sales force built for social channels

Vatas are always-on AI agents that live inside the social networks where your buyers spend their time. Connect LinkedIn, Reddit, niche forums, and inbound email, and the agents begin listening for buying signals, engaging with prospects, and booking meetings that match your ideal customer profile.

## Feed agents the knowledge that makes you different

During onboarding, you connect storage, analytics, and support systems so vatas learn your product, pricing, and customer stories. The knowledge hub keeps every snippet versioned and tagged, ensuring outreach stays on-message and compliant even as your positioning evolves.

## Human-in-the-loop when nuance is required

When a prospect asks something new, a vata escalates through the inbox for your guidance. Your answer is saved instantly so the next agent handles the question autonomously. You keep oversight of every conversation while letting AI handle the repetitive work.

## Pay only for the results you can see

Vatas operate on a pay-for-results model—if they don’t deliver qualified leads, you don’t pay. When volume ramps beyond twenty new wins a month, the subscription offers predictable pricing while retaining the same performance accountability.
